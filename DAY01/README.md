Day 01 — Why Terraform Exists (Infrastructure as Code Basics)

Part of the #30DaysOfAWSTerraform challenge by Piyush Sachdeva

📌 Topic

Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform fundamentals.

🧠 What I Learned

Before Terraform, infrastructure was built by manually clicking through the AWS console. This caused infrastructure drift: environments diverge silently and nobody knows why.

As a NOC Engineer, I've seen this cause real incidents at 2 AM. The question that always takes longest: "What changed?"

Terraform answers that question automatically, because everything is in Git.

❌ Problem — Manual Setup
Issue	Impact
Engineer A builds Dev → t2.micro	Different from Prod
Engineer B builds Prod → t2.medium	Config drift
No record of changes	Can't debug incidents
"Works on my machine"	Environment inconsistency
✅ Solution — Terraform (IaC)
One .tf file defines everything
Same code → Dev, Staging, Prod
Git history = full audit trail
Identical environments, always
⚙️ The 4-Command Workflow
bash
terraform init      # Download provider plugins (like npm install)
terraform plan      # Preview changes — dry run, nothing created
terraform apply     # Build real infrastructure via AWS APIs
terraform destroy   # Tear it all down cleanly — saves money
📄 My First Terraform Resource
hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"  # Mumbai — closest to Bengaluru
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0f58b397bc5c1f2e8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name        = "day01-demo"
    Environment = "learning"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    Challenge   = "30DaysOfAWSTerraform"
    Day         = "01"
  }
}
🌍 Why Terraform Over CloudFormation?
Tool	Multi-cloud	Language
Terraform	✅ All clouds	HCL (readable)
CloudFormation	❌ AWS only	JSON / YAML
ARM Templates	❌ Azure only	JSON (verbose)
💡 Key Takeaways
Infrastructure drift is a real production problem. Terraform prevents it by design.
terraform plan = built-in change advisory. Preview before you break anything.
Terraform is cloud-agnostic: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.
IaC means infrastructure is in Git: auditable, reviewable, rollback-able.
terraform destroy is your wallet's best friend when learning.
